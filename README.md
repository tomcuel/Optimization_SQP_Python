# Optimization Problem solving using Python and the SQP algorithm
> This is the code and LaTeX report for a small school project in which I implemented the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm to solve an optimization problem, minimizing an objective function under given constraints.

## Path Tree

## Virtual Environnment

## Librairies
I utilized Python libraries to automate the differentiation of mathematical expressions, eliminating the need for manual computation.
```py
from sympy import symbols, diff, lambdify, exp
```


## Auto Solving
```py
from scipy.optimize import minimize
```
